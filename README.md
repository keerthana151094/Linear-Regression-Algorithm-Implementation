# Linear Regression Implementation

This is a great way to learn and implement the linear regression algorithm from scratch by understanding the math behind it using several different approaches

## Background

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict real-valued output

### Approaches

You can implement Linear regression using one of the two methods

```
Gradient Descent
Normal Equations 
```
### Gradient Descent

Iterative method to find the optimal parameter(theta) value by minimizing the cost function(sum of squared errors). Iterates until it converges at a solution

### Normal Equations

This method will get an exact solution in one calculation. No iterations are involved.
